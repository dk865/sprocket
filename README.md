Sprocket is a Chrome Extension with 4 buttons (for now.) Button one is a link to my Construct 3 Planet Clicker, the html version. The second button is a link to my Rickroll Timer, which is also a construct page. The third button turns the current page into a fake error page, and the last button takes you to my 4 question achieve article website.

To Install:
Download the .crx file in the releases, then drag and drop it in chrome://extensions to install it. That's it!
